This document contains a number of programming exercises made for the course IN1900. The chapter numbers and titles correspond to the chapters of the book ``A primer on Scientific Programming with Python'' by Hans Petter Langtangen. 
The exercises are meant to be a supplement to the exercise collection in the book, and most are motivated by applications in science and applied mathematics. The exercise collection is used for the first time in 2018, and there may be typos and small errors. If you find any errors, or have other comments or questions about the exercises, please send them to Joakim Sundnes: \emph{sundnes@simula.no}.
