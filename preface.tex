This document contains a number of programming exercises made for the
course IN1900. The chapter numbers and titles correspond mainly to the chapters of
the book ``Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python'' by Joakim Sundnes.
The book is a short and updated version of the more extensive book
``A primer on Scientific Programming with Python'' by Hans Petter Langtangen,
and this exercise collection is meant to be a supplement to  the exercises in that book.
Most of the exercises are new, some are modified versions of exercises from the
book of Langtangen, and some are pure copies of exercises from that book, but updated to
Python 3. Most of the exercises are motivated by applications in
science and applied mathematics.

The exercise collection was first used in the
IN1900 course in 2018, but has been substantially updated and extended first in 2019
and then in 2020. If you find typos or have other comments or questions about the exercises,
please send them to Joakim Sundnes: \emph{sundnes@simula.no}.
